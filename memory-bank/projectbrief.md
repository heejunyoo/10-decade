# Project Brief: The Decade Journey

## Vision
"The Decade Journey" is a **private, self-hosted digital heritage system** designed to document and cherish a family's history over a 10-year period. Unlike commercial cloud storage, it focuses on **active recall**, **emotional context**, and **automated organization** using on-premise AI.

## Core Objectives
1.  **Preservation**: Store high-quality photos and videos safely on local storage.
2.  **Organization**: Automatically tag people (Face Recognition) and scenes (Vision AI) without manual effort.
3.  **Connection**: Bridge the past and future via "Time Capsules" and "On This Day" memories.
4.  **Privacy**: Zero data leakage. All AI runs locally (or via private API keys) under user control.

## Key Features
*   **Smart Timeline**: Infinite scroll journey through time.
*   **AI Biographer**: A daily interview bot that asks about specific photos to recover lost memories.
*   **Face Clusters**: Auto-grouping of family members using InsightFace.
*   **Map View**: GPS-based visualization of family travels.
*   **Time Capsule**: Digital letters sealed until a specific future date.
